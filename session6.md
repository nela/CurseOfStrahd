## Events

#### Visit Blinksy @ N7

- Enthusiastic greeting, shelves full of toys, many of them very strange, some
  disturbing, some destroyed.
- Blinksy seems as an emotional type. Shows as a doll with a sack of detachable
  heads, a velintroquist dummy that looks like Strahd, and another doll that
  looks remarkably like Irena.
- Says the shop goes badly, but his only customer has been Rictavio. Says he
  does not know why he got the monkey.
- Ran asks about magical toys. Shows a toy of a wizard with a staff and a
  serpent on top of it. The doll has no head, but only a hat. Says the doll is
  not magical.
- Ran intimidates Blinksy and asks about Irena dolls. Blinksy says that Isek
  threatens to burn his shop if he does not make these toys. Isek has described
  this person to Blinksy. He does not know why Isek wants these toys. How many
  toys? 1-2 a month for ca 5-6 years.

### Attacks during the night
- In the middle of night we are awoken by screams and disorder. Ran looks
  through the window and sees another humanlike figure ripping a fleeing
  civilian in half.
  In an attempt to get through to the roof Laucian stumbles and falls and runs
  around the tavern in search for cover. A figure of a warrior atop a
  fiery horse, holding a sword, is soaring through the sky towards the church.
  Upon a nature check, Laucian recognizes the [Nightmare](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16964-nightmare) monster, and knows that only pure evil can ride such a monster.

- Combat with vampire. He died.

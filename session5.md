  Find empty bottles, Wizards of wines.
- Another room: Bridal gown. Mirror with gilded frame.
- Another: Short pull rope from the wooden trapdoor in the ceiling. Open the
  trapdoor to the loft.
- Loft: shrouded in cobwebs. A small table. Go into another room. Full of old
  and forgotten things, see path through the maze to another door.
  Door: scraped skull and *ALL IS NOT WELL*. Etched into the skulls forhead is
  a bearly visible magic glyph. Try to understad words behind the door but
  unable.
- Furniture made to a study. Skeletal cats. Children with their backs to the
  door. they do not percieve someone entering the room.
  On table: Lots of sheets of parchments, magical symbols. Children are just
  dolls dressed as children. A book on the floor, The same magical circle
  around book. A spellbook with lots of different spells. Teleportation circle.
  Take the book with me. A figure appears and aks me to tell him who am I ans
  what I intend to do. He materializes in front of me and says I will not find
  Strahd here.
- Introduces himself as Victor Valakovich, son of Mayor. Ha dabbles in magic, a
  self taught mage. He wants to teleport away from Boravia. Does not know the
  mage by the lake. Set up a meeting to learn spells from him. North of the
  city, where whew people live. At 10. Do you like toys from Blinksy. Izek,
  likes toys from Blinksy. Who is Izek? A huge guy that sends firebolts from
  his arms, that his father uses to take care of things. Why does his father
  terrorize people? To break dissidence. Passive perception says there is not
  much more than what exactly his says. He has never heard of Irena Kolyakova.

- On the way back Laucian sees his own reflection in the gilded mirror, but
  also sees a hooded figure. Fails on arcana check. Saw another face and torso.
  White hood.

##### Talk with Mayor
- Speak about festival, bakeries. Mayor asks Ismark and Irena to hold a speech
  at the festival, about bringing together Boravia and Valkia together and
  making them happy through festivals.
- Petrovna, has a strange, almost manical, laughter.
- Ismark says it is quite brave to speak so freely against Strahd. Mayor says
  that Strahd has not been seen in Valakia for hundreds of years. Their
  festivities keep him away. Recommends Valakia before Krezk, says it is safer.
- Will expose poeple that for are working for Strahd on pillory. How can anyone
  be for Strahd, asks Ismark.

##### Dealings
- Laucian tells about his investigation.
- Irena and Ismark leave at the dawn of the next day. Maybe Ran can use
  *Disguise Self* to look like Ismark.

#### Around the city
- N8: City square. People with crude donkey heads on pillory.
  *Come one come all for the greatest festivity... All will be well. Attendance
  and children required*
- While at N8 a man comes and introduces himself as Ernst Larneck. He comes on
  behalf of lady Fiona Wachter. She has gotten interest for us, and has asks us
  to come to their residence.
- Before we go, a large man with a burnt arm comes to City square to the Statue
  and proclamation. He removes  the standing proclamation and hangs up new
  procalmation *Come all to the festival of the Blazing Sun.. Attendance and
  children required. All will be well*

#### With Fiona Wachter
- Ernst lead us to N3
- Fiona says that mayor is not well. Leads a reign of illusion and terror.
  Ran asks how she can then dare to say this, and Izek doesn't come for her.
  She says that, while she does not have xplicit relation with Strahd, the fear
  of her blood relation keeps mayor and Izek away. She introduces us to an
  alternative, that all is not well.
- An option to choose for oneself to believe and hope. One should not be put
  into dungeon for believing so. She does not plan a coup, but want to change
  how it is. She says that she does not want Strahd here, and thinks he is bad,
  but mayors approach is terrible.
- Ran confronts her and says she only wants Strahd here.
- Do you have any network? Not really, only mayor and guards control the city.
- Claims no relation to Strand except her bloodline from long ago.
- How can you prove you wish the city well and not only takeover the city from
  Strahd? What about Laucian? She says that he unfortunately is biased.
- Anything you want us to do? She says that she only wanted to speak to us and
  give us a more nuanced picture.
- Ran asks to *Detect her thoughts*. She says she has nothing to hide be she
  does not want to share her other thoughts.
- About Victor? Her daughter and Victor were to marry, but he threw a spell on
  her/ or psychological warfare and she now thinks she is a cat. Laucian: Is
  your daughter mad? Yes, unfortunately. Was young and beautiful but was
  corrupted by that family. Why would Victor do cast that spell?
- Does she know Henrich the casket builder? Strahd seems to have had contact
  with him?  Fiona gasps - What makes you say that? Ran tells about vampires,
  and shares information to her, in his good belief. She seems suddenly
  distraught. Means that in this case, it may be best to inform the mayor so he
  will use his town guards to eradicate these.
- Asks us to meet her tomorrow. Ran says that he is not interested in this
  internal politics stuff, and mostly interested in leaving Barovia. She says
  she can show us around the city, and tell some stories about what has
  happened. Say we might be here at 6.
- Vistani camp outside, as scary as people sound? The group is now controlled
  by two young guys, far more violent than their father. Laucian says, we've
  heard they work for Strahd.
- Is Izek loyal to mayor? Very loyal and very stupid. Like an adoptive son to
  mayor. Was a violent child, and killed another child as young. Mayor has made
  Izek to what he is today.

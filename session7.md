## Events

### Upon Waking Up
- Ran has a dream. Ismark and Irena continue to Krezk.

### Meet with Victor
- 'What a night' - 'Tell me about it'. Spell trading ensues.
  Ran learns Charm persons, Detect Magic, Misty Step, Suggestion,
  Counterspell, Fireball, Fly, Greater Invisibility, Ice Storm, Cone of cold.

  'What do you know of Fiona Wachter?' - Everybody knows she tries to steal
  power. He says it was an arranged marriage, but it was not a good fit. He did
  not make her crazy, she was that well before they met.

### Festival
- Dim mood. The mayor has Fiona Wachter in chains. He intends to execute her
  due to her being in relation to Strahd and is accomplice to last nights
  events.
  Ran disguises himself as Ismark, and comes up to the stage with the mayor.
  Ran launches a pitch for a ritual require to scare Strahd away, in order to
  take Fiona. Ran charms the mayor who then agrees but says to take Isek with
  him.

### Fionas Basement
- Fiona: 'Let the dead remain dead'. Bones come up from the basement and
  immediately attack.
  Laucian ask Fiona: What is the meaning of this? She says these are her defenses,
  which she requires as everyone is sceptical to her. We believe her when she
  says she had nothing to do with the attack

- Ran asks Isek about dolls. He is perplexed, and tries to break free.

- Isek says the dolls are in the image of his sister. Once Isek was young he
  had a sister, and they were in the woods. And they were separated when wolves
  came.
- Combat breaks out again. **Isek ded**.

### Post Combat
- Fiona suggests to take out Iseks head, and present it. No one will fear mayor
  anymore - she suggests a coup. We comply.

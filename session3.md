- Palm reading of Irena: 'She is not the one you think. Irena is Tatjana.'
  - Irena is disturbed by this, asks clarification.
  - When people die in Borovia, their souls cannot leave Borovia thus their
    souls are reborn. Irena is Tatjana reborn. Tatjana was Strahds lover,
    killed by
  - Strahd 450 years old. Conquered this land. Was to marry Tatjana, but
    Tatjana fell in love with his brother Sergev. Strahd accepted at first, but
    pain consumed him thus he killed his brother. Tatjana could not bear this,
    and threw herself from a cliff.
  - Guards saw this and fired upon Strahd. However, Strahd struck a deal with a
    God to honor them with the land of Borovia if they made him immortal. This
    God binds Strahd to this land, and due to the God's powers Strahd cannot
    die.

- Questions
  - Do not enter the windmill, it is possessed by some great evil.

    can be spoken with. Must find him in order to speak with him.
  - Show figurne. Strahd struck a deal with the God at a temple no one knows
    where is, but she thinks it may still exist.
  - Show angels feathers. The most tragic story in Borovia. Tells about a
    divine being that is corrupted by Strahd.

- Rictavion, carneval master, introduces himself - he comes here involuntary
  like most. Good with animals. He is interested in Vistanis. Ran says they
  have an undeserved reputation.
- Gave away his monkey to the toymaker named Blinksy. Blinksy is right south of
  here. Blinksy makes macabre toys. Gave his monkey to Blinksy as he seems very
  pitiful, a representations of this city. Ran tells about the dream and
  fortunetellers. Rictavion says to follow him.

#### Following Rictavion
- Leads us to N5

  that he is not really a carnival master. His real name is Dr Rudolf Van

#### At the Church
- Go to church with Ismark and Irene.
- See signs of a flaming torch.
- Meet the priest Laucian Petrovich. Ask him if Valaki is safe. He does not
  know if the city is safe anymore. Recommends Krezk and the bishop in Krezk.
- The Mayor thinks that festivities keep Strahd away, while infact it were the
  bones of an old saint. However, his bones have been stolen and darkness is
  further approaching.
- The priest told a little boy, Yeska, that these bones protect from Strahd in
  order to comfort him. However, the boy has said this to someone. Will not
  tell who this was.
- He would appreciate us to speak with this boy. He is at the church

#### Speaking with alter boys
- He does not know, but maybe Milivoj, another alter boy does.
- The priest says he has suspected that Milivoj might be responsible. We should
  be aware of his temper.
- Speaking with Milivoj. He told it further to Henrik Van der Voort, a local
  chest maker for a sum of money. He stole these bones for him.
- Henrik looks a bit scary, but is normal. Comes always alone, never seen him
  with anyone else. His shop is right by the stockyard.
- Update the priest about this. He becomes troubled. He is afraid this is
  Strahds plot. Asks to check this out.
- Vitsani camp below here works directly for Strahd.

#### Speak with Henrik
- Deathly Silence. Says to go away.
- Kick in the door. Where are the bones?
- Brings it from the wardrobe and his storage unit.
- A merchant, Vasily von Holtz, offered a lot of good business for these coins.
  He suspects this man was Strahds.
- As we leave, he tells us that there are 6 vampire spawns in some chests in
  his home. We debate what to do. Ran wishes to burn the house. Laucian wishes
  to fight them.

#### Deliver bones to Laucian
- St. Andrew was a priest that for many years ago was in contact with Morning
  Lord. Says this magic is important to keep Strahd away. Ask to show us where
  the bones were.
- Show us whole beneath the floor planks. Nothing beneath.
- Ask about dragon house. One of Strahds enemies was a great dragon.
- Tells about Fiona Wachters, a noble woman, that shares bloodline with Strahd.
  Her support to Strahd is almost explicit. Two sons: Nicholai and Carl that
  often hangout at the Bluewater Inn. The mayor does not dare to go to
  these.
- Ask about Petrovna - Laucians Sister, Mayors wife. Committed to mayors cause.
- Asks about Windmill. Abandoned for as long as he can remember. Heard it is
  occupied by evil.
- Never heard about Dursts. However, his own family is one of the oldest,
  going centuries back. Lydia Petrovna, one of his ancestors was a priest
  living simulatenously as Strahd. She is buried at his castle.
